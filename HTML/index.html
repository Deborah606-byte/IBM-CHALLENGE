                    and so have not yet attended to this section yet. 
                    Agriculture is beneficial for the economic growth of a country as well as been a key for food security</p>
                   <p>
                    Due to many factors, agriculture has been threatened and farmers do no longer get enough yields that do in the past.
                    Climate change which contributes to changing weather conditions, polluted water bodies due to illegal mining in most part of Ghana has led to unproductivity of the agriculture sector.
                    Many has seeked to help this sector by providing machineries like bulldozers and also fertilizers to encourgae farmers to produce more.
                    </p> <br> 
                    <p>
                    There are even farmer's day to congratulate farmers who have been productive. But with all these, there are missing factors that is not helping the sector at all.
                    We are in a 21st Century where technology is used in every part of our lives to make it easier. From cashless transactions to self driving automobiles. Technology is on the rise but the agricultural
                    sector in Ghana has not yet embraced technology. Many are used to the old method of farming which has been passed on from generation to genertaion.
                    </p><br> 
                    <p>
                    We are not saying these methods are not useful but we want to enhance these methods of farming to help the agricultural sector to be more productive.
                    Farmers will get the opportunity to use technological tools which can help them to produce more yeilds than they do.
                    They will be able to use technologies for irrigational purposes, check weather conditions, application of fertilizers or insecticides and harvesting crops.

                    Agriculture is still remains very important even in this present technological era and below are few of them:
                    <ul>
                      <li>It is the main source for raw materials been it sugar or wood which are imporatnt to major industries for manufacturing purposes.</li>
                      <li>Agriculture is beneficial for international trading. Countries export agriultural products and some import them also. If a nation's agriculture suffers for some reason, prices may rise and the flow of commerce may be disrupted.</li>
                      <li>It helps in increasing a nation's revenue when products are exported.</li>
                      <li>The agriculture sector remains one of the biggest source of employment. Be it a fermer, harvester, technician, scientist, there are many job opportunity in this field. Agricuture help reduce high rate of unemployment also help reduce poverty.</li>
                      <li>The economic development is greatly tied to the agricultural sector. A nation benefits from decreased poverty and accelerated economic growth when trade, national income, and employment are combined in a good way. One of the finest methods to hasten development and raise a nation's standing internationally is to do this.</li>
                    </ul>
